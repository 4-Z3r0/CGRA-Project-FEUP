# CGRA_Project_FEUP

A project for the CGRA course (Computer Graphics).  
CGRA is a 2nd year, 2nd semester course (more info here:  
https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/ucurr_geral.ficha_uc_view?pv_ocorrencia_id=399891)
The project's theme is the implementation of an interactive scene through the modelling of various components

The scene includes a controllable car, a moving crane which interacts with the car, multiple light sources and a terrain.  
The user can control the car using the WASD keys (move forward, turn left, move backwards and turn right).  
Whenever the car is on top of the target the crane picks it up and moves it.  
The car speed and the light sources are controllable through the interface.
